# Burger Project

##### This is my first project made with reactJS.
<p>The design may not be pretty, since the focus right now is mainly on functionality.</p>

<p>The main idea is to make an app where we can order a burger by choosing our combination of ingredients and calculate
    the total price adding all of the ingredient prices and extra incentives if available.</p>

**The project idea is obviously from a tuto vid.**
